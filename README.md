# Data 'trained' Discord-Bot (Alpha)
Discord bot that 'trains' from messages you and your users send. When pinged it will display random text! 

### Deploying locally

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 (preferable, not necessary)
* Java 17 (preferable, not necessary)
* Visual Studio (VS) code or any other code editor

```cmd 
pip install nextcord
```

### Setup
1. Insert your discord bot token in: TOKEN = "" . (You can find your discord token in your developer portal)
2. Run!
3. Enjoy

### Current problems with the bot
• Since the bot is 'training' from your messages, it tends to output it's own mention multiple times.
• If the messages you send are the same you will see similar outputs every time.
